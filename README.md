Final year project for students entering or attending college that are unsure about their chosen course.
They can view courses by filters of college, area of study and points necessary for the course. Courses can be saved
to a users profile to later review. A student can take a number of tests to determine what sector of work to enter and 
help determine the kind of thinker they are. A student can save their test results for later inspection if necessary.
